//Problem Statement:
//Implement a BankAccount class in Java that performs basic banking operations such as deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.
import java.util.Scanner;

// BankAccount class
class BankAccount {

    double balance;

    // Constructor to initialize balance
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    // Method to deposit money
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance = balance + amount;
        System.out.println("Amount deposited: " + amount);
    }

    // Method to withdraw money

        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance");
        }
    }

    // Method to check balance
    void checkBalance() {
        System.out.println("Current Balance: " + balance);
    }
}
